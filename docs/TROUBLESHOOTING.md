# Troubleshooting Guide

## üîä Voice/Speech Issues

### No Voice Reminders When Looking Away

**Symptoms:**
- Face tracking works
- Look away but hear no prompts
- "Enable Voice Reminders" is checked

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Browser Console**
   ```javascript
   // Open DevTools (F12) ‚Üí Console tab
   // Look for these messages:
   // ‚úÖ "üëÅÔ∏è AttentionPrompter initialized"
   // ‚úÖ "üëÅÔ∏è Focus lost, starting timer..."
   // ‚úÖ "üîî Prompting: [message]"
   ```

2. **Verify Mode**
   - Voice reminders only work in **Prompting Mode** and **PRT Mode**
   - Not available in Assessment or Research modes
   - Check mode badge at top of screen

3. **Test Speech System**
   ```javascript
   // In browser console:
   import { speechManager } from './utils/speech-manager.js';
   speechManager.speak('Testing voice');
   // Should hear "Testing voice"
   ```

4. **Check Timing**
   - Wait 4 seconds after looking away
   - Minimum 10 seconds between prompts
   - Won't prompt if already speaking

5. **Browser Audio Settings**
   - Check system volume is up
   - Check browser tab not muted
   - Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
   - Check browser allows audio autoplay

6. **Force Restart**
   - Stop tracking
   - Refresh page (F5)
   - Start tracking again
   - Look away and wait 4 seconds

### Educational Content Not Speaking

**Symptoms:**
- Click topic buttons but no voice
- Content appears but silent

**Solutions:**

1. **Check Speech Toggle**
   - Look for "üîä Enable Educational Speech" checkbox
   - Must be checked for speech
   - Located below topic buttons

2. **Check if Speech is Busy**
   - Wait for current speech to finish
   - Only one voice at a time
   - Educational speech waits for attention prompts

3. **Test Direct Speech**
   ```javascript
   import { speechManager } from './utils/speech-manager.js';
   speechManager.speak('Education test');
   ```

### Voice Conflicts / Overlapping

**Symptoms:**
- Multiple voices talking at once
- Speech cuts off unexpectedly

**This should NOT happen** - SpeechManager prevents this.

**If it does:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Refresh page completely
3. Report issue (this is a bug)
